# InHospital_Mortality
Preditive Modelling of In-Hospital Mortality Following Elective Surgery

This analysis is focused on the Inpatient hospital mortalit following elective surgeries in the state of Florida. Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration, inatient discharge data was linked with CMS Hospital compare dataset to anlayze the effect and contribution of various patient and hospital factors. Data used for this project was for the period 2016-2019. 

Machine learning algorithms were implemented and  mortality was modelled using stepwise logistic regression  and Gradient boosting machines models. All the date cleaning and prepr was performed in STATA, whereas modeling was performed using R Studio. 

Access to FL AHCA is subject to a Data Use Agreement and authorization by the Florida Agency of Health Care Administration, all of the authors on this project have authorization to utilize this data set for research purposes. (CMS Hospital compare is publicly available)

We have made sure that all the analysis is thoroughly reviewed to be error free, furthermore all the results have been hidden that may lead back to tracing individual identiies. All the coding steps involved in linking, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis and modeling have been listed below with the name of each file. Code for all steps involved in cleaning, linking, pre processing, propensity matching and modeling has been shared.
